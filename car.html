<p>Originally, the R8 had a V8 engine of 4.2 liters and 420 hp, but in 2008 the V8 was supplemented with a more powerful 5.2 l V10 from Lamborghini Gallardo of 525 hp and 530 Nm. Both engines were also offered in an R8 Roadster, a convertible model with a fabric roof. The V10 engine was also in the R8 GT, a lightened special version.</p>

<p>In 2013, the R8 got a facelift with new taillights, headlights, new grille and new color combinations. They then also stopped offering the R-tronic gearbox, which was replaced by the S-tronic dual clutch gearbox.</p>

<h2><strong>History</strong></h2><hr>
<p>The series-produced Audi R8 began production as the 2007 model in Neckarsulm, starting in the fourth quarter of 2006. Introduction to the market took place in the second quarter of 2007. Just as in the Audi A2, and the A8, the R8 is based on a frame called Space frame, an aluminum frame where the body parts are welded, screwed or glued. In production, 5,000 unique parts are put together by 70 workers who assemble 25 cars per day. Later, the car is inspected by 95 laser beams which in five seconds check that the car at over 220 points has a maximum deviation of 0.1 millimeters compared to the drawings (ie the CAD files).

<h2><strong>The commercial</strong></h2><hr>
<p>When the car was launched, the commercial for the car received media attention. The film shows how the car, which is the fastest series-produced car Audi has ever made, is slowly built up and gets the slogan "The slowest Car we've ever built" (The slowest car we've ever built). What attracted attention in the film, however, which was directed by Michel Gondry's brother Olivier Gondry, was the theme song <i><b>The Beep Beep Song</b></i> by the American Singer songwriter Simone White and was compared to Oh Laura's song <i><b>Release me</b></i> in the 2007 Saabre commercial.

<h2><strong>Audi R8 TDI Le Mans</strong></h2><hr>
<p><b>The Audi R8 TDI Le Mans</b> was unveiled in January 2008 at the Detroit Auto Show and in March at the Geneva International Motor Show. The model has a high-performance 12-cylinder TDI diesel engine and went on sale in the summer of 2009.</p>
